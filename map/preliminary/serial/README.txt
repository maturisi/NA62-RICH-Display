folder 'out' contains the map
folder 'in' contains hand written files with serial number of the PMT
folder 'log' contaions PMTs logbook e.g. replacements, missing labels
all other .txt files are intermediate to obtain the map

a bash script 'generate.sh' in folder 'work' is used to generate the map. 
it uses the serial numbers and implements in software the logic used in the construction.
